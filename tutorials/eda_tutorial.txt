EDA
Synonym Replacement (SR): Randomly choose n words from the sentence that are not stop words. Replace each of these words with one of its synonyms chosen at random.
Random Insertion (RI): Find a random synonym of a random word in the sentence that is not a stop word. Insert that synonym into a random position in the sentence. Do this n times.
Random Swap (RS): Randomly choose two words in the sentence and swap their positions. Do this n times.
Random Deletion (RD): For each word in the sentence, randomly remove it with probability p.


The stopwords are a list of words that are very very common but don’t provide useful information for most text analysis procedures.
While it is helpful for understand the structure of sentences, it does not help you understand the semantics of the sentences themselves. Here’s a list of most commonly used words in English:
N = [ 'stop', 'the', 'to', 'and', 'a', 'in', 'it', 'is', 'I', 'that', 'had', 'on', 'for', 'were', 'was']
Stop words are words that are so common they are basically ignored by typical tokenizers.
With nltk you don’t have to define every stop word manually.
